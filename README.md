# Graphical Language Tool

This project is an example GUI to show some of the capabilities of C# including drawing simple shapes, running commands, parsing data, validation and how to use version control. 

To use this tool you need to run GraphicalLanguageTool.exe in the bin/debug folder.

The username is james and the password is 1.

There is Unit tests for each of the main forms (login, main, paint) aswell an xml documentation.
I have inserted a method for using a factory class to display how one would work using multiple classes in the same function.

The drawing tool allows a user to create shapes of different size and to draw with a fully functioning Pen tool.

The command line allows the user to input arguments to parse the data.
